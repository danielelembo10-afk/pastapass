# Staff playbook — PastaPass 10+1

1) Ask: “Are you on **PastaPass** yet?”
2) New? Send them to /signup. Returning? Scan the QR on the counter.
3) Keep the **Staff QR** page open on the tablet. New code every ~30s.
4) After payment, have the guest scan the staff QR and enter their email/phone to add a stamp.
5) When reward appears, redeem it and reset counter. One stamp per paid pasta. Be kind but firm.
